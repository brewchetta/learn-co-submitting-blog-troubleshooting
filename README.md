# Troubleshooting Guide: Submitting Your Blog Through Learn-Co

If you're having trouble submitting your blog through the learn-co website, you aren't alone! In order to publish a blog, learn-co hosts its blogs through [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). More often than not, it's an issue with creating the repository that causes publishing to fail.

### First: 
See if you already have github pages set up. Search for one of your repositories called `username.github.io` where `username` is (you guessed it) your github username!

### If You Have A Repo:
You'll need to delete it. Click on settings and scroll all the way down to the bottom where you'll see a danger zone that includes an option to delete the repo. Follow those steps and then head back to learn.co and attempt to publish again. Your attempt to publish fails, follow the steps below as though you didn't have a repo.

*If you were using github pages for anything other than your blog, that work will be deleted as well. You may be better off maintaining a blog from a different source like medium.com.*

### If You Don't Have A Repo
A repo for pages should have automatically been created by learn.co but sometimes it doesn't work as intended. Since something went wrong, we'll need to create it manually. Create a new repository by clicking the "+" in the upper right corner of the page. You want to name it `username.github.io` where `username` is your github username. Once that's been done, attempt to publish your blog again.
